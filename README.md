# Traffic-light-Optimization

This is my work to the Alibaba Big data competition held in December 2014.

This project focus on managing the time of traffic light of big crosses in the city of Guiyang to reduce the total waiting time.

We have been given the traffic flow distribution in Guiyang and the road construction of Guiyang. Then we should give out all the traffc lights status for every 30 secs.
